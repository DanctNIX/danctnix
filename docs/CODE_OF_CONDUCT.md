# Code of Conduct

This document lays out the ground rules for everyone participating in the DanctNIX Community (or projects associated with the community).

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.

-----
__**Goals:**__

The first goal of this Code of Conduct is to specify a standard behavior so that people with different communication styles can talk effectively, productively, and respectfully.

The second goal is to provide mechanisms and guidelines for conflicts in the community when they arise.

The final goal is to make the community a welcoming place for people. For a community to be successful, it needs lots of people contributing to conversations, so others could join in and contribute more.

With that said, a healthy community must allow for disagreement and debate. The Code of Conduct is not a mechanism for people to silence others with whom they disagree.

-----
__**Do**__

- Be conservative in what you send and liberal in what you receive. You should not send heated messages (we call these "flames") even if you are provoked.  On the other hand, you shouldn't be surprised if you get flamed and it's prudent not to respond to flames. Productive communication requires effort.

- Be specific and don't bother others, including pinging (unless given). In general, most people who use the Internet don't have the time to answer general questions. Be patient when you ask for help, we're not a tech support company.

- Remember that the people here are human beings whose culture, language, and humor have different points of reference from your own. Be especially careful with sarcasm. Not everyone is using their native language, so meaning and tone can be lost in translation.

- Use emojis or smileys to indicate tone of voice, but use them sparingly.  Don't assume that the inclusion of a smiley will make the recipient happy with what you say or wipe out an otherwise insulting comment.

- Interpret arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree. When we do disagree, try to understand why. Avoid non-constructive criticism, don't merely attack the state of affair, offer (or at least solicit) suggestions as to how things could be improved.

- **Keep up to date with this Code of Conduct**. It may be amended from time to time, and it will be your responsibility to be aware of these changes.

-----
__**Don't**__

- _**Name call, throw insulting remarks or belittle other people's personal features**_
    + Personal features include nationality, race, creed, color, ethnicity, religion, age, gender, politics, ideas, knowledge, opinions, size, shape, hobbies, pets, sexual orientation, or any other.

- _**harassment, bullying, hate speech**_ - this also includes trash talking, elitism over other people, technologies, phone brands, operating systems, window managers and etc.

- _**use slurs or racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist**_

- _**post spams**_ - this includes posting copypastas, chain mail, bot usage, flooding, sending "walls of text".

- _**talk about politics, religion or other sensitive topics**_ - we recommend you to discuss that somewhere else.

- _**shitpost**_ - all shitposting should be kept outside general and other channels, they'll be allowed in #trash channel as long as it doesn't break other rules from this CoC.

- _**distribute copyrighted or stolen material**_ - links to stolen material such as music, videos or pirated software will be removed immediately.

-----
__**Our Responsibilities**__

- The moderator team is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

- The moderator team has the right and responsibility to remove messages, images, videos, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to kick or ban (temporarily or permanently) any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

- The moderator team is dedicated to providing an environment where participants feel welcome and safe.

-----
__**Keep in mind**__

- People are complicated, you should expect to be misunderstood and to misunderstand others. When this inevitably occurs, resist the urge to be defensive or assign blame. Try not to take offense where no offense was intended. Give people the benefit of the doubt. Even if the intent was to provoke, do not rise to it. It is the responsibility of all parties to de-escalate conflict when it arises.

- Rules may not be enforced all the time, 24/7, and will heavily depend on the severity and attitude of the people. That said, there's always a limit: if you feel like someone else have gone past it, please contact the moderator team.
